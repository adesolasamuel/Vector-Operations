# Vector-Operations

Implementing Vector operation using C++

Vector operations, Extension of the laws of elementary algebra to vectors. They include addition, subtraction, and three types of multiplication. The sum of two vectors is a third vector, represented as the diagonal of the parallelogram constructed with the two original vectors as sides.

# Available Vector Operations
1. Magnitude/Modulus of a Vector
2. Vector Addition including both 2D and 3D vectors
3. Vector Subtraction including both 2D and 3D vectors
4. Scalar Multiplications of vectors
5. Vector Dot product
6. Vector Cross product
7. Unit Vector
8. Vector Direction Cosines
